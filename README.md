# 🎮 Project: LAMA Card Game 🃏

## 📝 Description
LAMA is a dynamic and colorful card game designed for 2 to 6 players, where the main objective is to get rid of your cards as quickly as possible. The game is played with a deck of 56 cards, including numbered cards from 1 to 6 and a special Lama card. Points are counted using black and white tokens worth 1 and 10 points respectively.

## 🎯 Basic Rules

1. **🃏 Dealing the Cards:**
   - Each player receives 6 cards at the beginning of the game.
   - The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the first card of the draw pile is turned over to start the discard pile.

2. **🔄 Gameplay:**
   - Players must get rid of their cards by placing them on the discard pile.
   - The cards played must match or have a value one higher.
   - On a Lama, the only cards that can be played are either a 1 or a Lama.

4. **🏆 End of Round and Scoring:**
   - The round ends if one of the players has no cards left in hand or if everyone has passed.
   - Each player counts the values of the remaining cards in hand (each value is counted only once and the Lama counts for 10 points). The value is then distributed as tokens.
   - If a player manages to have no cards left at the end of a round, they remove one of their tokens.

5. **End of the Game:**
   - The game ends when one of the players reaches a total of 40 points or more.
   - The winner is the one with the fewest points.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of the game is to get rid of all your cards first and have the fewest points at the end of the game.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Target Audience
The game is suitable for children and adults, offering a fun and competitive gaming experience for the whole family.
